# Objective
The project “Online Food Recipe” is a web-based platform developed with PHP and MySQL, providing users with the ability to register, log in, and share their recipes. The system ensures secure user authentication, facilitates recipe creation, and includes a payment system for users to access recipe upload features. Users can enrich their experience by connecting with each other, building a sense of community through friend additions. Additionally, the platform incorporates PHP scripts for payment verification, allowing users to add recipes only after a successful payment of Rs 100. The system further enhances user engagement by generating an analysis report, summarizing key metrics that provide valuable insights into the overall usage and engagement on the platform. The project's structured design, organized files, and integration of HTML/CSS and JavaScript contribute to a seamless user experience, fostering easy navigation, recipe sharing, and connections among cooking enthusiasts.
